Activity 1 - Python Inventory System

Create an inventory program using the following data structures:
* A list to store item names
* A dictionary to store the corresponding item prices
The program should allow the user to:
* Add a new item
* Ask for the item name
* Ask for the price
* Add it to both the list and dictionary
* Prevent duplicate item names
Update the price of an existing item
* Ask for the item name
* If it exists, update its price
* If it doesn't exist, show an error message
Use loops and conditionals for the menu.
Do NOT include deleting items or out-of-stock features.
